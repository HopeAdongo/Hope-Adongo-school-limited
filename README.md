OUR TASK
PREVENTING AND CONTROLLING HIV IN KENYA, EAST AFRICA

BUILDING THE FUTURE
Our Purpose
We are a support group of HIV-positive individuals engaged in HIV prevention work. We provide sanitary pads, toiletries, undergarments, school supplies, food, and body lotion to orphaned young schoolgirls who are impacted by HIV and come from the most vulnerable and underprivileged backgrounds. We think that by doing this, we are empowering the girls not only for future independence, but also for protection against STIs, HIV, and other illnesses, as well as early marriage and pregnancy.

THE FUTURE
OUR GOAL
As we strive for self-sufficiency, we think that if we had access to land and equipment, we could grow our own food instead of relying solely on donations.
